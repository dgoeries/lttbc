# lttbc: Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets (Python using a c implementation)
This is a low-level implementation of the `Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets` (LTTB) downsampling algorithm written in Python.

The code has been translated from the work of Sveinn Steinarsson (https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/flot-downsample/).
